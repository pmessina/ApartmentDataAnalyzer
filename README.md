# ApartmentDataRepository

Purpose: 
The idea of the Apartment Data project is to compare distances from the work place to different plot points on a google map.  In addition, I would like to compare apartment rent prices and square footage.

Functionality: 

Take address data plots on a google map and display Apartment names are listed in a checked listbox.
As each name is selected, a point will be plot on a map.  The viewport of the map shifts to that point.  All points could be viewed at same time or a particular selection.
Once youâ€™re done selecting apartments, you enter an address of a workplace or plot the location on the map.
Once done with workplace input data, the screen will output a table of all the apartments selected,  the floor plan prices and square footage, and the distances from the workplace.
